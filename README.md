**Progressive Web Apps** are experiences that combine the best of the web and the best of apps. They are useful to users from the very first visit in a browser tab, no install required. As the user progressively builds a relationship with the App over time, it becomes more and more powerful. It loads quickly, even on flaky networks, sends relevant push notifications, has an icon on the home screen and loads as a top-level, full screen experience.



- **Progressive** - we'll use progressive enhancement throughout
- **Responsive** - we'll ensure it fits any form factor
- **Connectivity independent** - we'll cache the app shell with service workers.
- **App-like** - we'll use app-style interactions to add cities and refresh the data.
- **Fresh** - we'll cache the latest data with service workers.
- **Safe** - we'll deploy the app to a host that support HTTPS.
- **Discoverable and installable** - we'll include a manifest making it easy for search engines to find our app.
- **Linkable** - it's the web!
